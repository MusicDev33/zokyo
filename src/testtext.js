    Here are the steps to invert a function:
    
        Start with the original function, y = f(x).
    
        Switch the input and output variables to get x = f^-1(y).
    
        Solve for f^-1(y) by isolating y on one side of the equation.
    
        The resulting expression will be the inverse function f^-1(x).
    
    Note that not all functions can be inverted, and for those that can be inverted, the inverse function may not be defined for all values of the original function.`,
